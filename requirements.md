# JanMitra AI — Requirements Document

## 1. Project Title
**JanMitra AI — A Sovereign AI Welfare Agent for Bharat**

---

## 2. One-Line Pitch
JanMitra AI is a multilingual, consent-driven AI welfare copilot that helps citizens discover, understand, and apply for government schemes effortlessly through conversational interaction.

---

## 3. Problem Statement

India launches hundreds of welfare schemes aimed at improving the lives of its citizens. However, a significant portion of these benefits remain unclaimed due to:

- Lack of awareness  
- Complex eligibility criteria  
- Bureaucratic language  
- Digital literacy barriers  
- Fear of paperwork  
- Fragmented information across multiple portals  

Citizens often do not know which schemes they qualify for, where to apply, or how to complete the process.

**Benefits exist — but access does not.**

There is a critical need for an intelligent, accessible system that bridges this gap and ensures that no citizen loses their entitled benefits due to informational or procedural challenges.

---

## 4. Vision

To build India’s AI-powered welfare access infrastructure that transforms government benefit discovery from a complicated search process into a simple, citizen-first conversation.

JanMitra AI aims to become a digital bridge between citizens and public welfare systems.

---

## 5. Solution Overview

JanMitra AI is an AI-powered conversational agent designed to:

- Understand a citizen’s profile  
- Identify eligible government schemes  
- Explain benefits in simple, local language  
- Assist with application preparation  
- Guide users through documentation  
- Enable consent-based form automation  

Instead of forcing users to navigate complex websites, JanMitra interacts through familiar platforms such as WhatsApp, reducing friction and increasing accessibility.

## 6. Why AI is Necessary

AI enables:

- Natural language conversations  
- Context-aware responses

Thus, AI is not just an enhancement — it is essential for delivering scalable and human-like assistance.
