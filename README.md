## ❗ The Problem

India offers hundreds of welfare schemes, yet millions remain unclaimed.

Not because citizens are ineligible —  
but because the system is difficult to navigate.

People struggle with:

- Lack of awareness  
- Complex eligibility rules  
- Bureaucratic language  
- Digital literacy barriers  
- Fear of paperwork  

**Benefits exist — but access does not.**

## 💡 Our Solution

JanMitra AI transforms welfare access from a complicated search process into a simple conversation.

Instead of forcing citizens to browse multiple portals, JanMitra:

✅ Understands user profiles  
✅ Identifies eligible schemes  
✅ Explains policies in simple language  
✅ Guides documentation  
✅ Assists with application preparation  
✅ Enables consent-based automation  

All through familiar platforms like WhatsApp.
